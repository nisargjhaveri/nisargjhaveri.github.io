                    <p>A Humanoid Graphing Calculator, a web application, completely
                    written by me in vanilla JS. It can understand many type of mathematical
                    expressions without excessive use of brackets (just as we write in a note-book).
                    And plots the expression on an interactive virtual graph paper(canvas).
                    It is completely responsive web-application with many more features.
                    Technologies used were HTML5, JavaScript, CSS.

                    online presentation application, supporting animations, slideshow,
                    remote control for slideshow, etc. I also worked on cloud file storage
                    and management system and base framework to accommodate different
                    application in same UI and structure. Technologies used were HTML,
                    JavaScript (with jQuery), PHP (with CodeIgniter MVC framework), MySQL,
                    CSS, Git.

                    in our college and still in use.

                    <p>I have some problems with big frameworks that does everything for me
                    without me knowing what they are doing... Also, I have problems with
                    using others libraries rather than writing myself (But sadly,
                    I cannot write everything myself :/). So here is a really minimal
                    MVC framework with routes and helpers and library support.
                    Obviously, with the basic concepts of MVC. It is writen mainly in PHP,
                    with MySQL support for database.

                    The website is built upon <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nisargjhaveri/minimalMVC">minimalMVC framework</a>
                    developed by me. Also, the website was highly dynamic and was back-boned by
                    an in-house CMS developed by us to make data management easier for those
                    who don't want to touch code for every single change in the website content.
                    Technologies used were HTML5, JavaScript (with jQuery), PHP, MySQL, CSS, Git with GitHub.
