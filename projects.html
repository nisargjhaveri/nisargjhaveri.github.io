                        written by me using only vanilla JS. It can understand many type of mathematical
                        expressions without excessive use of brackets (just as we write in a note-book)
                        and plots the expression on an interactive virtual graph paper(canvas).
                        It is a completely responsive web-application with many more features.
                        Technologies used were HTML5, JavaScript, CSS.

                        online presentation application supporting animations, slideshow,
                        remote control for slideshow, etc. I also worked on a cloud file storage
                        and management system and base framework to accommodate different
                        applications in the same UI and structure. Technologies used were HTML,

                        CSS, Git.

                        <p>I have some problems with big frameworks that do everything for me
                        without me knowing what they are doing... Also, I have problems with
                        using others' libraries rather than writing myself (But sadly,
                        I cannot write everything myself :/). So here is a really minimal
                        MVC framework which also supports routes and helpers and libraries.
                        It is written mainly in PHP, with MySQL support for database.

                        <p>A desktop app, for my school using <a target="_blank" href="http://appjs.com/">appjs</a>
                        immediately after I graduated. Tagging parts of a diagram with correct labels was one
                        of the common problems we used to get in school syllabus and exams. We used
                        to practice it on a paper with a book. So, I made the app that can teach you,
                        can help you practice and also take a test. Teacher just has to add all the
                        diagrams with correct labels once. It supported multiple languages and was a cross-platform
                        application.

                        The website is built on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nisargjhaveri/minimalMVC">minimalMVC framework</a>
                        developed by me. Also, the website was highly dynamic and was back-boned by
                        an in-house CMS developed by us to make data management easier for those
                        who don't want to touch code for every single change in the website content.
                        Technologies used were HTML5, JavaScript (with jQuery), PHP, MySQL, CSS, Git with GitHub.
