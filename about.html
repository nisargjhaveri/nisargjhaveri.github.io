                    <p>Hello, I am Nisarg Jhaveri.

                    <p>I am currently (in 2015, in case I stop maintaining this page in future!)
                    a undergraduate research student of Computer Science and Engineering at
                    <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.iiit.ac.in">IIIT-H (International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad)</a></i>.
                    I completed my whole schooling at <i>Pravrutti Vidyalaya Jeevan Bharti, Surat</i>.
                    Also, I spent my whole childhood in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat">Surat</a>, a city in
                    southern <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat">Gujarat, India</a>.
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati_language">Gujarati</a> is my mother tongue.
                    I also speak <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>

                        <h2>My journey with the computers</h2>

                        <p>I like computers a lot! The journey began years ago, when I was really small.
                        I don't even remember when I first used computer. But I could make some decent (for an 8 year old)
                        animations in <i>Macromedia Flash</i> (I don't know which version I used to use) in 2003.
                        I still have some animation files from 2003. Before that I used to draw something in
                        <i>CorelDRAW</i> (I knew a lot later what its actual use was!). I lost all the files long ago,
                        but some of the drawings are still in my mind! And this thing goes on... I tried my hand on all the
                        programs installed on the computer, some times resulting into crash or blue screen of death!

                        <p>Then comes the <i>Microsoft FrontPage</i>! I always wanted to make a website, but didn't have
                        any idea about code or anything! I started playing with that software. Around that time one of
                        my elder cousins randomly showed me the HTML editor in <i>FrontPage</i> and showed me how to set
                        the title of the page with some odd pair of tags. And everything changed! It was around the time
                        when I was 12 or something.

                        <p>Now I had a whole new world to explore. I started exploring HTML. That lead me to CSS, JavaScript.
                        I also tried my hands on <i>ASP</i>. Around that time, I somehow switched to Linux!
                        It was the summer of 2010, when I started using <i>Ubuntu 10.04</i>. As a result I also switched to PHP.
                        Ever since then, Ubuntu has been my OS of choice.

                        <p>In next 2 years I used and learnt Web Technologies a lot. I also tried my hands on <i>Linux Shell Scripting</i>.
                        They also tought me HTML, JavaScript, C, ActionScript at school (It was a different story that
                        they were a little late to teach me most of these. :P). But this sequance of events made me clear that
                        I actually liked programming and wanted to do this for a long time.

                        <p>After 12<sup>th</sup>, I took admission in IIIT-H. I got to know a whole new world of
                        <i>Open Source</i> programming and community really closely. I started involving myself with the
                        Free and Open Source Software developement and it is really fun! The whole idea is just fascinating!
                        By now I have also added some more programming languages and technologies to my skillset.

                        <p>By now, I am pretty confident on my programming/scripting skills. My mind is starting to divert from
                        learning new languages and technologies to solving some real world problems! Before this, I have done this
                        a few times, but the goal was always to learn something. Now, maybe as the result of me being a research
                        student, the goal is changing to discover things or make new things! Let's see where it goes! :D

                        <h2>Me outside the computers</h2>

                        <p>Other than computers, I like spending some time with nature. It is a coincidence that my name 'Nisarg'
                        in many India languagues means 'Nature'! I have experienced a number of trours across India with my parents.
                        Also, several tracking trips to Himalayas. I have always enjoyed this. I also like to swim.

                        <p>I also like reading good stories or novels. I generally read Gujarati novels.

                        <p>I like watching movies, too. I also enjoy live performances like some nice music or theater arts.

                        <p>I also enjoy family or other gatherings. I can't mix-up easily with new people and talk to them that easily.
                        But still I enjoy meeting a bunch of new people, unless they force me to speak! Interestingly, if these new
                        people is talking about something of my interest like programming (Sorry, I was not talking about computers here! :P),
                        then I have lesser problem mixing up with them! :P
